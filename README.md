# Overlapping Circular Avatars

This plugin takes a comma-separated string of image URLs and generates HTML to display these images as overlapping circular avatars with inline CSS.

## How to Use

1. Create a join list of image URLs
2. Point the experimental code column to that CSV string of image URLs
3. The column will return an HTML string. Insert this value into a Rich Text component in Glide.
